        <b>Meteroite Alarm - <font color="green">Finished</font></b>
        <hr>
        <p>Meteorite-Alarm was the first game I've ever made when I was 10 years old. It was in a workshop that my mother 
        booked for me. It was the first time I've ever coded something. I ended the project in Early 2024. I know it's long 
        for such a game but I took long breaks in between for personal reasons. It's a simple javascript game with a spaceship 
        that has to avoid meteorites. The spaceship is controlled with WASD. You can regenerate and use your shield too.</p>
        To play it, click <a href="Meteorite Alarm/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <b>My old website - <font color="green">Finished</font></b>
        <hr>
        <p>This was the first website I've ever made (I recently changed it a little, because there were personal informations 
        on it). I coded it in an informatic working-group. Yeah... in german it's just called AG or "Arbeitsgemeinschaft". It's a 
        course for students from students, where they meet together after school so work. In this case it is coding. I coded it 
        with my mentor in Early 2022. It was just a small project so it's not that good but I worked on it for several hours so please 
        be kind. I was jung and I wasn't good. There used to be links to my friends' websites but i can't find them and I 
        doubt that they are still online.There is also the old version of "Meteorite-Alarm" on it. It could be interesting to see 
        how it looked like in the past (little tip: you control the spaceship with the arrow keys).</p>
        To see it, click <a href="Website Old/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <div class="card">
        <b>SpaceCraft - <font color="green">Finished</font></b>
        <hr>
        <p>This is a project in Three.js (that is a tool in JavaScript to make 3D games). I started it also in Early 2022 in the informatic 
        working-group but it didn't go as well as the AI so it's not finished and I'm not working on it. If you still wanna see how it 
        looks you can click on the link. You should be able to control the player with WASD.</p>

        <b>Better Minecraft - <font color="orange">In Progress...</font></b>
        <hr>
        <p>Better Minecraft is a game I started in Early 2024 to quickly refresh my knowledge about HTML, JavaScript and 
        CSS, because we had it in the informatics-lessons. It slowly got a bigger project than expected so it's not finished 
        yet. In the game you have a Player that you can control with WASD. There are enemies which swords oder bows that want to 
        kill you. It's an infinite world which means that there is no limitation. It's only limited by your GPU and Memory 
        Ressources. I hope you have fun playing it and don't wonder why it's called "Better Minecraft". I don't know ether.</p>

        <b>Planet B - <font color="orange">In Progress...</font></b>
        <hr>
        <p>Planet B is a colonization game where you have a planet that you colonize and build your empire. It's a clone of 
        Planet S which isn't that big but it's a cool game for everyone that wants to try. There nothing more to say as the game 
        is still in very early developing.</p>

        <b>Game of Life - <font color="green">Finished</font></b>
        <hr>
        <p>Game of Life is a clone of the original John Conway's Game of Life. Game of Life was developed in 1970 from John Conway 
        and it's about drawing structures that live and react to each other. It's pretty simple but you can build enormous things. 
        Like I said it's not my game and I just tried to make it in JavaScript.</p>
        To play it, click <a href="Game of Life/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <p>I hope this could give you a good look at my programming skills. If you have any questions about any of the projects please contact me!</p>
