    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Marshmallow868. I am programming since I was 10 years old in Late 2019. I first startet coding in JavaScript in a 
    workshop where I also made my first game: "Meteorite-Alarm". But I didn't know the full protential of JavaScript so I quickly 
    quit it and startet learning Python with a book I got on christmas. After that I made some more projects but that all didn't 
    really give me the feeling I wanted. Then I learned the basics of C/C++ which was also in a workshop for coding. Now I forgot 
    most of it and I realised how good I am in Web Developing for my age. So now I only code in HTML/CSS and Javascript to be better 
    and get a my dreamjob: Frontend Web Developer. I don't know if I will make it but I really hope so. Thank you for reading this. All my 
    big projects are listed on the "Projects" site.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I dont have many hobbies. As you already know I am coding in my freetime. But I also do badminton since 2022. It's a 
    cool sport. Probably nothing for someone with low endurance because it's very challenging. I am also training everyday with 
    some fitness-equipment. It's not as good as in the fitness-studio but it's enough for me.</p>

    <h2>Knowledge</h2>
    <p>I have some knowledge in multiple programming-languages, for example:</p>
    <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>C/C++</li>
        <li>C#</li>
    </ul>
    <p>but I am best in:</p>
    <ul class="custom-list">
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>I first started coding with Replit and it's pretty good for beginners but as I grew up I used to see more Environments 
    so now for coding I use Microsoft Visual Studio Code. It's very practical for programming so you always have everything 
    on your personal computer. It's also quickly extendable by adding "Extensions" on the Website or in the application itself. 
    There are very good extensions, for example: "Microsoft Edge Tools" when you are coding in HTML/CSS.</p>
